Transfer Overview & Setup
=========================

An item must be inventoried before it is transferred.

Destination Folders
*******************

Newly created disk transfers are stored on the transfer server (Z or V drive). On the Z drive, there is one folder per accession, and within these folders, one folder per digital media number.

All transfers are stored in a directory with the name of the ID auto-generated by the Digital Media Log. These directories are located in a parent directory with the FA or Accession number.

Choosing Transfer Method
************************

Disk images are single files containing the complete content and structure representing a data storage medium or device. There are different types of images. Forensic images perfectly replicate the structure and contents of a storage device, and allow the viewing of deleted files and slackspace (i.e, the unused space in a disk cluster). Logical images [AD1] are not true forensic images; and do not include file slackspace. In general\ *,* all physical media is imaged as a physical image, and all digital materials received via a network transfer will be logically imaged. Variations from this policy will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

At this point in time, disk images are created in-house for optical disks (DVDs and CDs), external hard drives, USB Flash drives, 5.25-inch floppy disks and 3.5-inch floppy disks (recently dated disks that are PC-formatted). We do not have the capacity to image Bernoulli disks, Jaz disks, and 8-inch floppy disks. Please notify the Head of Digital Programs if you encounter media not detailed in either list above.

The hardware used to create images will vary depending on the type of digital media. Optical disks (DVDs and CDs), external hard drives, and USB Flash drives will be imaged using the FRED.

Recording Transfers in Digital Media Log
****************************************
When a digital media item is imaged or otherwise has its contents transferred, this must be recorded in the Digital Media Log.
