In general, optical disk images will be forensically imaged using FTK Imager or BitCurator. Forensics images cannot be made for Audio CDs. Please see `Audio CDs`_ for instructions.

The following describes how to create disk images using FTK Imager. FTK
Imager is digital forensics software used to create disk images of
