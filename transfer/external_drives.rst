Imaging Instructions: Hard Drives & USB Flash Drives
====================================================

The following describes how to create disk images using **FTK Imager** on the FRED.

External hard drives and USB Flash drives need to be imaged using the FRED because it has a hardware write blocker. External hard drives and USB Flash drives need to be connected to the Tableau UltraBay write blocker on the FRED, and the Tableau UltraBay needs to be turned ON. 

1.  | Turn on the Tableau UltraBay write blocker on the FRED. Two green lights should appear – the Power light and the WrtBlk light. Do not plug in your device unless these lights are on.
    

2.  | Open FTK Imager and click **Create Disk Image** in the **File Menu** Select the source evidence type. Hard drives and thumb drives are physical media, so select **Physical Drive**.
    

3.  | Select the **Source Drive Location**. This can be a little confusing, as the program picks up all connected drives – including the one you’re working on. The FRED machine has quite a few drives. You can distinguish between them by using the data size listed in the dialog box. For example, two of the drives are listed at 2000GB and 7999GB, respectively. You can also disregard the WIBU Codemeter Stick USB device, which is a USB key to run the Forensic Toolkit. Click **Finish** to continue
    

4.  | A dialog box will appear, this time asking where to store the image. Click **Add.** Before the location of the image file can be identified, the type of image file to create needs to be selected. We use the E01 file format. Click **Next** to move forward.
    

5.  The Evidence Item dialog box will appear. Insert the digital media ID associated with the item into the Evidence Number field. This is generated by the Digital Media Log. All other fields can be left blank.

6.  The next screen prompts you to identify where the disk image will be
    stored. All images should be stored on the
    **TransferFiles**\ *(\\\\raqiq01*)(\ *Z:*) drive, in a folder that
    lists the accession number of the material. If the accession number
    isn’t available, use the FA number. Complete the fields as listed
    below.

    a. | **Image Destination Folder:** Save the image on    TransferFiles(\\\\raqiq01)(Z:). The folder the image is stored    in follows the naming convention of: [accession    number]\_[digital media ID] or [FA number]\_[digital media    number].
		 
    b. | **Image Filename:** The Image Filename is the digital media ID.

    c. **Image Fragment Size:** The Image Fragment Size should be set to  0 (zero).

    d. **Compression:** The Compression level should be set to 0 (zero).

    e. **Use AD Encryption:** Leave this unchecked.

7.  | Click **Finish** to return to the Create Image dialog window, this time with the necessary information completed. Double check the **Image Source**, the **Image Destination**, and that both **Verify images after they are created** and **Create directory listings of all files in the image after they are created** are checked. Click **Start** to initiate the imaging process.
    

8.  | A Creating Image dialog window will appear. It will indicate how much time has elapsed during the creation of the image.
    

9.  | Once completed, the Status will read **Image created successfully**. You will also receive notification that the Directory Listing was created successfully. In the image destination folder, you will see the image (.E01), the Directory Listing file (.csv), and the Verify Results file (.txt). The Verify Results Summary contains the same data presented in the Image Summary area below. This information contains the image checksum information needed for the Digital Media database.

10. Make sure to safely eject the hardware you were imaging. Failure to
    do so can result in irreparable damage to the media.
