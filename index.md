## Recording Transfers in Digital Media Log

1. When you have finished transferring a digital media item, changed the transfer status to "Transferred - Failed" or "Transferred - Success" as appropriate.

    <div class="docs-example">
      <p>Note: If transfer fails initially you may need to try again; appropriate number of transfer attempts is dependent upon type of media.</p>
    </div>

2. Record the transfer method. Record the successful method if multiple methods were attempted.
3.  When you changed the transfer status from "Not Transferred," the "Date Transferred" autopopulated with today's date. Correct if needed.
4.  Record whether the physical digital media item is to be retained due to artifactual value or disposed of. This is to record the disposition of the physical media item and not the appraisal of the contents of the digital media item.
