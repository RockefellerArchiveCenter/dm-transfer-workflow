title: "Rockefeller Archive Center Digital Media Transfer Workflow"

## Digital Media Transfer Overview

This is the Rockefeller Archive Center's documentation for digital media inventorying and transfer workflows using the Digital Media Log, a tool for documenting the discovery of digital media items as well as the transfer actions applied to those items. For the purposes of inventorying and transferring digital media at the RAC, the term digital media is used to describe the various data storage devices records creators use to store born digital material. Examples of the types of digital media items that these workflows address include optical disks, hard drives and flash drives, and 3 1/2 and 5 1/4 floppy disks.

The workflows were written to empower archivists to process records consisting entirely of digital media as well as to process digital media records found in mostly analog or mixed collections. Their use supports the RAC's objective to preserve and provide access to archival records, regardless of format.
