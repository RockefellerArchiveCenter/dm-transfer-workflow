## Digital Media Transfer Overview

This is the Rockefeller Archive Center's documentation for digital media inventorying and transfer workflows using the Digital Media Log, a tool for documenting the discovery of digital media items as well as the transfer actions applied to those items. For the purposes of inventorying and transferring digital media at the RAC, the term digital media is used to describe the various data storage devices records creators use to store born digital material. Examples of the types of digital media items that these workflows address include optical disks, hard drives and flash drives, and 3 1/2 and 5 1/4 floppy disks.

The workflows were written to empower archivists to process records consisting entirely of digital media as well as to process digital media records found in mostly analog or mixed collections. Their use supports the RAC's objective to preserve and provide access to archival records, regardless of format.

## Required Steps for Transferring Digital Media at the RAC

There are 4 required steps to correctly inventory and transfer digital media. The steps require the use of various tools, hardware, and workstations, and digital media transfer files will need to be saved and moved to different destinations, depending on the stage in the workflow as well as the specific tools used to complete a workflow step. The end result will be a transferred digital media item, free of viruses and malware, stored on the Digital Records (X) Drive with complete documentation of the item and the transfer actions applied to it saved on the Digital Media Log.

The steps should be completed in order.  

1. Inventory digital media item using Digital Media Log
2. Transfer digital media item using appropriate hardware and tools (If you experience difficulties using the available tools for transferring digital media items consult the [Troubleshooting page](troubleshoot))
3. Document transfer using Digital Media Log (If digital media item failed to transfer, you cannot proceed to the next step)
4. Scan digital media item for viruses using Ginger workstation
