title: "Inventorying Digital Media Items"

## Overview

Digital media items should be inventoried as they are encountered during
processing. In order to save a digital media item record, you must
supply the RefId of the appropriate file-level component and retrieve
the file and resource titles. For minimal processing, you may supply the
RefId of the series-level or subseries-level component. Do not create an
item-level record in ArchivesSpace during the inventorying process.

## Setup

The Digital Media Log is located at
[dm-log.rockarch.org](http://dm-log.rockarch.org/).

## Instructions

1.  Add a new digital media item record.
2.  The digital media item ID field will autopopulate.
3.  Copy the RefId for the parent component from ArchivesSpace into the
    "ArchivesSpace RefID" field and click "Find in ArchivesSpace." (Make
    sure the component has been saved in ArchivesSpace.)
4.  The component and resource fields should autopopulate. If they do
    not, contact the administrator.
5.  Choose the appropriate format from the drop down menu.
6.  If you are ready to transfer the item, continue to [transfer setup](index#transfer-overview-&-setup)
