title: "Inventorying Digital Media Items"

## Overview

Digital media items should be inventoried in the DM Log as they are encountered during processing. In order to save a digital media item record, you must supply the RefId of the appropriate item-level component and retrieve the item and resource titles. For minimal processing, you may supply the RefId of the series-level or subseries-level component. Digital media items should be described as a sibling relationship to their parent units and should have the same box and/or folder instances. Do not create a child relationship to represent the association between the digital media item and the parent unit.

## Setup

The Digital Media Log is located at
[dm-log.rockarch.org](http://dm-log.rockarch.org/).

## Instructions

1.  Add a new digital media item record.
2.  The digital media item ID field will autopopulate.
3.  Copy the RefId for the parent component from ArchivesSpace into the
    "ArchivesSpace RefID" field and click "Find in ArchivesSpace." (Make
    sure the component has been saved in ArchivesSpace.)
4.  The component and resource fields should autopopulate. If they do
    not, contact the administrator.
5.  Choose the appropriate format from the drop down menu.
6.  If you are ready to transfer the item, continue to [transfer setup](transfer-instructions#transfer-overview-&-setup)

## Recording Transfers in Digital Media Log

1. When you have finished transferring a digital media item, changed the transfer status to "Transferred - Failed" or "Transferred - Success" as appropriate.
    <div class="docs-example">
      <p>Note: If transfer fails initially you may need to try again; appropriate number of transfer attempts is dependent upon type of media.</p>
    </div>
2. Record the transfer method. Record the successful method if multiple methods were attempted.
3.  When you changed the transfer status from "Not Transferred," the "Date Transferred" autopopulated with today's date. Correct if needed.
4.  Record whether the physical digital media item is to be retained due to artifactual value or disposed of. This is to record the disposition of the physical media item and not the appraisal of the contents of the digital media item.
