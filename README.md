# RAC Digital Media Inventory & Transfer Workflow Documentation

Documentation for digital media inventorying and transfer workflows using the [Digital Media Log](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/dm_log) at the Rockefeller Archive Center. Digital media encompasses the various data storage devices records creators use to store born digital material. Examples of the types of digital media items that this documentation addresses include optical disks, hard drives and flash drives, and 3 1/2 and 5 1/4 floppy disks.

The RAC developed the Digital Media Inventory & Transfer Workflows as part of its efforts to preserve and provide access to archival records, regardless of format.
