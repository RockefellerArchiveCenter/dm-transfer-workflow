Inventorying Digial Media Items
===============================

Overview
--------
Digital media items should be inventoried as they are encountered during processing. In order to save a digital media item record, you must supply the RefId of the appropriate file-level component and retrieve the file and resource titles. For minimal processing, you may supply the RefId of the series-level or subseries-level component. Do not create an item-level record in ArchivesSpace during the inventorying process.
